LC Data Analysis - Regressions
========================================================

This document presents the results of the following analysis:

- regression between interest rate & FICO score
- regression between interest rate & debt-to-income ratio
- regression between interest rate & loan amount

Furthermore, the following visualizations are included:

- histogram of loan grades.
- histogram of loan sub-grades.
- plot of interest rate vs. loan sub-grade
- plot of interest rate vs. annual income

Note that:

- the FICO value used is the average of "fico_range_low" and "fico_range_high".
- loans where annual income was declared to be greater than $500,000 were not included in the analysis. These data points were considered to be outliers.
- the sections of analysis described "as broken down by loan list date" were arrived at by looking at the loans in 6 month intervals starting from 2007-06-01 and ending at 2014-06-01.
